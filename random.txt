ascent rate of balloon:
     v(h) = v₀*e^(-h/H)

- v(h): the ascent velocity at altitude h
- v₀: initial ascent velocity near ground level (h ~ 0)
- h: altitude
- H: scale height of the atmosphere(the vertical distance you must go up for the air density to drop to about 37% of its previous value)
- (-h/H): as h increases, exponent becomes negative

radiation formula:
    radiation decreases due to:
        - reduced atmospheric shielding
        - increased cosmic ray flux
    
    empirical model:
        R(z) = R0*e^(z/Hr)*(z/zmax)*e^((1-z)/zmax),

        where:
        - z = altitude in meters
        - R0 = base radiation (ground level)
        - Hr = scale height (~7000 m)
        - zmax = Pfotzer maximum altitude (~17,000m in the UAE)
